# mec-website

Download the whole repo. Then, go to one of the two folders, open any one of the 10 .html files inside, and there's the website.

The "archive" folder is the old, first-iteration website.

The "color-experimentation" folder allows you to pick and choose colors for the theme. You can play around in the :root ruleset.
There is an accent color, primary text color, and primary background color.
